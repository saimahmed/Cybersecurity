# Cybersecurity
Creating a cybersecurity program for an insurance technology company -
Experience Overview -
In this experience, me and my team will be responsible for creating and implementing an enterprise security program for a company that utilizes AI technology. Me and my team will be considering all of the action items for a Security Project and managing them accordingly and securely. This may sound like a no-brainer, but a lot of planning and analysis is needed here. I will be working with various project stakeholders to ensure their needs are m
et, voices are heard, and most importantly that the project is completed on time, on-budget, and in the most secure, risk-free way possible.

At the end of the team sprint, I'll receive a Clicked Certification of Completion and an IBM SkillsBuild Digital Credential! 

Lemonade, an emerging online insurance provider, faces the challenge of lacking a comprehensive cybersecurity program suitable for its unique business scale and scope. In this scenario,I will collaborate with an external team to develop and implement a tailored cybersecurity strategy that aligns with Lemonadeâ€™s size and diverse service offerings, most especially as they launched their AI model to predict catastrophes and claims, and uses that data to price their policies.

What I will learn - Stakeholder Collaboration - I will learn the importance of stakeholder collaboration in implementing a security program, including conducting interviews and gathering insights to align the program with organizational goals. 

Strategic Planning - I will develop skills in creating comprehensive security plan proposals and roadmaps, ensuring alignment with business objectives and addressing the evolving needs of the organization.

Risk Management - I will gain expertise in identifying and addressing risks within an enterprise environment, understanding how to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities to create a robust security plan.
